## Instructions

1. Fork this [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-cities-starter-create-datajs-x63y0?file=/src/App.js)
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.
1. Submit the assignment (instructor to provide guidance)

## Requirements

the all the static HTML and when your ready to begin comment all the code. 
1. Create a <b>data.js</b> file in **src** folder. In the **data.js** file create a new array called **images** and populate it with the 4 images found in the html. 
2. Import **data.js** into **App.js** and map over the array to create the small images.


Your desgn must include a single **App** component that renders all the HTML and supporting click functionality.  


## Suggestions To Getting Started

- Copy all the HTML from public/html and paste it into App's return() statement. Resolve any possible errors regarding className or otherwise
- Write some pseudocode to work through the logic

## Bonus 1 - Traffic Light

## Bonus 2 - Memory Game

Convert the following [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jkeohan/pen/opvVGN?editors=0010) into a single React Component and implement the logic for click events and adding state.

## Bonus 3 - Lifting State

This is an advanced bonus and requires that you do additional research on lifting react state. 

Try creating additional components for the images. You will most certainly run into issues with breaking the **onClick** functionaltiy.
